## MaG Attacking Policy

No guild is specifically off limits unless listed under the *No Hit List* section. We do, however, ask that the following guildlines are followed when attacks are made.

1. If the guild is similar in might to us, but part of a larger family they should not be attacked.
2. If the guild has sigificantly more might than ours, they should not be attacked.
3. If the guild is in an alliance with any of our allies they should not be attacked.
4. If the guild is our ally, family, or in a NAP with us they should not be attacked.

In most other situations you are free to carry out any attacks that you see fit. If a guild or player in a guild is attacking our hive you have **every right** to defend yourself and attack them back without any sort of repercussions. If you have any questions you are encouraged to contact the Sargeant at Arms (the R5 if no Sargeant at Arms is posted).
