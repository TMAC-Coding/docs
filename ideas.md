Some ideas to better prosper MaG:

1. Restructure R4 roles (more on the role responsibilities later):
   1.  Diplomatic Recruiter
   2.  Activity Manager
   3.  Sergeant at Arms
   4.  Instructor
2. Have a more hierarchical leadership setup, but still require all officers (R4+) to agree on major changes.
3. Major changes (mergers, migrations) require a unanimous outcome. Everything else just needs majority.
4. All R4s report directly to the R5 with progress reports and updates.
5. All R4s in a role to recruit helpers, which would become R3s.
6. R3s would report directly to the R4 in charge of a specific role.
   * Example: a Diplomatic Recruiter could have a feeler going out looking for lone players to recruit into the guild. This would give the R3 some responsibility and some ownership with the guild. It would also help us shape players to step into R4 roles if they become open.
7. Guild ranks will have meaning now. R3s will be hand picked by an R4 for a specific spot. R2s will be players who have shown great activity in the guild with event participation, in-game and Discord chat activity.
8. R2 is only given based on **current** activity. No one is auto-promoted based on their might, stats, or previous affiliations.
9. All current R2/R3 will be subject to the new structure, no one is grandfathered in.
10. Focus less on who has lost what and more on what they have contributed to the guild. Losing a leader shouldn't be a big focus if it's a once in awhile thing and the player is consistantly active and just slipped up because they had too many drinks the night before.
11. Discord needs pushed. **HARD**. We need people in there and they need to be active. Not everyone can be in the game all the time, and Discord is a heck of a lot easier to open up and take a quick peek at on your phone than the game is.
12. Weekly meetings should be held to get a progress report on things, then a summary guild wide in-game mail will be sent out.


_Note: This list will be expanded on when I think of things. I will make adjustments based on feedback from people. We will release this list to the public when it's fully complete and agreed on by all._
