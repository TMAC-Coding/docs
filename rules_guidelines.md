# A Rabbit's Guide To The Guild

This will describe what we stand for. As a member of the guild you are expected to check this regularly to keep up with all current rules and expectations. This guide will do the following:

* Explain leadership and how it works.
* Go over the rules and punishments for not following them.
* Detail how much you should be growing in the guild.
* Go over what is expected for each event.
* Explain the guild bank and how you can benefit best from it.

## The Leadership

This guild is ran by a council. Every R4 and up decide any significant decision that affects the guild as a whole. Most changes to the guild only happen when a majority of the leadership agrees on it.

Every R4 has a role that they perform to help make the guild run smoothly in all regards. If you have a specific issue, contact the R4 in charge of that area. If no results are met, or you're not sure who to contact, message the R5 and things will be taken care of.

R3s in this guild play a major part as well. They are hand picked by an R4 to assist them in their role. Generally R3s are being tailored and trained to become future R4s when the need arises. Don't come asking for a spot an R4 will find you if they think you're worthy.

## The Rules

1. Leaders are to be sheltered if they are not being used for attacking. Losing your leader stunts your growth, it reduces your castles effectiveness, and it makes you and the guild look bad. There will be, at most, two warnings for losing your leader. After that you will get kicked from the guild, regardless of your rank.
2. Troops should be sheltered under normal circumstances. If you do not have beds to heal them and you aren't using them, keep them sheltered. If your shelter is full reinforce a shielded player (with permission) or send them on a ghost rally (preferably against an unguilded c17+ player, or a darknest that is far away (more than 100m) from the hive).
3. Be active in the chat as much as possible. We're all here to have fun, and it's far easier to enjoy the game when people are social. You don't have to talk everytime you are online, but a few words here and there let us know you're alive!
4. Follow the Attacking Policy when attacking guilded players. Don't start something that you can't manage on your own.
5. Honor the first march rule. Do not attack another guild's monster if they have initiated the first attack. Do not march on a resource tile that another player has already started marching towards.
6. Don't be disrespectful to other guild members. Joking around is fine, but don't be a jerk.
7. Be active daily. If you can't, shield up. If you are going to be inactive for more than 2 days send out a guild wide mail explaining where you're going and when you plan to be back. It will be noted and you'll be safe from any inactivity based punishments.
8. Don't use the diplomacy board unless you're ordering food. All leadership requires a cut of the order.
9. Discord is mandatory. You can use Line, or WeGamers, or whatever you want as well, but being on the Discord server is required. There is a bot there with a lot of features to help benefit the guild, such as a darknest tracker and a siren feature. You can join the Discord server by following [this link](https://discord.gg/ExBTdrC). If your name differs from your name in game let the R5 know so notes can be made.

## The Punishments

The following things result in a demotion. R1s will be kicked (sorry).

1. Being inactive for more than 2 days without prior arrangements.
2. Spamming the chat with garbage and not following directions of an R4+.
3. Continusiously attacking guilded players without permission from an R4+.
4. Continusiously posting on the diplomacy board without being an R4.
5. Being constantly disrepectful to other guild members.
6. Continusiously losing your leader due to incompetence.

## The Growth (eww, not that one)

_The below numbers will change as the guild grows and becomes more mature. You are encouraged to re-read this section at least once every two weeks to ensure you are complying with the new minimums._

* Might required to join: 15 million
* Internal minimum goal: 8 million

The following is true for all ranks. Failure to grow at an acceptable rate (without prior arrangements being made) could result in a demotion or being removed from the guild to make room for active, growing, players.

* Players are expected to make a constant amount of growth per week.
* Players are encouraged to have a greater amount of core might than the minimum amount required to join the guild.
* For further Might Growth Requirements go to: [All Activity Rules](https://github.com/bunnybattalion/docs/blob/master/activity_rules.md)

## Inactivity, Monster Hunting, KvK (Kingdom Clash), Guild Showdown, Guild Fest, Guild Bash, War / Burn Sessions, and other activity Rules

* For all activity rules please go to: [All Activity Rules](https://github.com/bunnybattalion/docs/blob/master/activity_rules.md)

## Darknest Rallies

These are not a requirement, but joining and hosting them builds guild morale and displays good teamwork within the guild. The rewards are pretty good for the effort it takes, troop loss is minimal so there's no reason to not jump in a rally if you're online.

## The Bank

The bank is stilll pretty new. All members are encouraged to deposit any resource that is currently over their vault cap for protection. The following can be safe to assume:

1. No person will get resources from the bank if they have not sent resources to the bank.
2. Resources taken out can only equal 50% of what a person has put in.
3. People with higher priority items, research/construction, will get resources over things like healing and training troops/traps.
